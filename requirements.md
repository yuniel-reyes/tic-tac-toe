## Functional Requirements
1. Create an object that stores the gameboard as 
an array

2. Create a factory function that return a player
3. Create an object to control the flow of the game
Hint: If you only ever need ONE of something (gameboard, 
      displayController), use a module
      - If you need multiples of something (players),
      create them with factories.
